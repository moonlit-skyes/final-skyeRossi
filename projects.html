            <p>Project One: Most relevant to this website, HTML! I've made several websites and this, other, most recent website is currently my favorite of the bunch, even if its a bit garish in some aspects.</p>
        </text1a>
        <text2a class="text2a">
            <p>While uninteractable at the current moment I hope the screen shot will suffice until I can figure out how to compress a website into an iframe.</p>

            <P>One of my favorite parts of working in C# is that forms aren't manual when it comes to visual design.</P>
        </text1b>
        <text2b class="text2b">
            <p>Project Two: I've also coded in other languages! Like C# for instance. I've made several applications in the language!</p>

            <p>Project Three: Graphic design is also something I've been working on in my spare time! The art was commissioned from a lovely artist known as Artcher Artwork, I modified it heavily for use in the card.</p>
        </text1c>
        <text2c class="text2c">
            <p>This is a Magic: the Gathering card based off one of my D&D characters Tik-Tak the owl! She uses a deck of cards to cast spells and defend herself as she assists the feywild carnival.</p>
        </text2c>
        <text1d class="text1d">
            <p>Graphic design also applies to some original work I do artwork wise. This is a painting I made recently of a childhood favorite of mine, Diaboromon.</p>

        <text2d class="text2d">
            <p>Project Four: A playmat that I've designed entirely on my own with artwork of my own for the Digimon TCG. I play competitively by virtue of the entry fee of $5 that I pay every other Tuesday. I do not win much.</p>

            <p width=100%>Project Five: In addition to my other creative works I'm a writer! Mostly with short stories but I'm also good at writing to fufill demand. I once ghost wrote a dog's autobiography. Only one copy was published though so if you find "Brutus's Meandering Journy" just know it was me.</p>
